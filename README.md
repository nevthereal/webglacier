# WebGlacier

## About this repository

This is the official repository of WebGlacier. What is WebGlacier though? It is my agency for creating fast, responsive and beautiful websites. Right now the website is under construction, but I am planning to add some more stuff in the near future, so this website can ship in early 2024.\
This is the first time I am using SvelteKit for production. I'm using [Skeleton UI](https://skeleton.dev), a convenient UI Library for SvelteKit using Tailwind.
